# Random Python Scripts

These 'poorly' written but working scripts are just examples.

1. Funfacts - Just an example of how to scrape a site using beautifulsoup

2. http_alert - Checks a site for a 200 status code, if any other value it will send an email.
NOTE you will need to specify a SMTP relay in order to send the emails.
